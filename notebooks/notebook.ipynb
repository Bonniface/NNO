    "\n",
    "This project aims to enhance neural network efficiency for resource-constrained devices through the combined application of pruning, quantization, and weight sharing, integrated with Dispersive Flies Optimization (DFO). The goal is to reduce the model's size and computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for deployment on devices such as IoT devices, microcontrollers, and smartphones.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.6 or higher\n",
    "- PyTorch\n",
    "- Scikit-learn\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the repository**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-optimization.git\n",
    "   cd neural-network-optimization\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m venv venv\n",
    "   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install the required packages**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install -r requirements.txt\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Training\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define and train your model**:\n",
    "   - Implement your neural network model in `model.py`.\n",
    "   - Train your model using the dataset of your choice (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply pruning to the trained model**:\n",
    "   - Use magnitude-based, structured, or L1 norm-based pruning methods.\n",
    "   - Fine-tune the pruned model to recover accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantize the pruned model**:\n",
    "   - Apply post-training quantization or quantization-aware training.\n",
    "   - Calibrate the model with a representative dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply weight sharing to further reduce memory usage**:\n",
    "   - Cluster the weights into groups and share the same value within each group.\n",
